How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I had less information to analyze and thus it was easier to spot the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could easily revert back if something goes wrong. 
    Also I can compare versions and see what changes led to the encountered behavior.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you can separate commits logically and you history won't be clattered with small changes
    cons: you can forget to commit or choose inappropriate size of commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because they are made for different purposes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to view history for repository
    git diff is used to see difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You are not afraid to introduce changes cause you can return to an older version any time you want

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To store my code for some Udacity and Coursera projects
